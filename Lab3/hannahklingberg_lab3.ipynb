        "All functions passed their tests, and are thus correctly implemented. I have not implemented any error handling, and thus assume that the input is correct, which is a weakness of the algorithms. The two first iteration functions, Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, could also be solved with the use of Richardson iteration, but I chose not to do so and instead use the equations as defined in the book. For the Newtons method to solve non-linear equation systems I had some trouble to come up with a test case, so I used one from a former student. "
